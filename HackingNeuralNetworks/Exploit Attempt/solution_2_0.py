Solution to Exercise:

The idea is to add a small network infront of the target
we want to bypass. We want to train that small network
to generate just one single image that gives us access.

This sounds harder than it is:
1. Load up the target network and make it un-trainable (we don't
   want to change it)
2. Add a small network infront of it, that is supposed to create a fake
   image which the target network thinks grants access
3. Set the output of this entire network to "access granted"
4. Train it and let backpropagation do its magic. It will attempt
   to train our small network in such a way that it gives the correct
   input to the target network, so that "access granted" lights up
